            <p> My name's Jade, Iâ€™m 22 and I am part of the yummy treats family. I have a sweet tooth for baked treats and chocolate and my number one favourite treat to bake would chocolate fudge brownies because they taste yummy and are easy to do with young kids too. Check out the recipe on the website to find out for yourself how tasty they really are. </p>

            <p>My name is Sally and live in Leeds. I enjoy cooking and baking, or just being in the kitchen - my favourite recipe would be a chicken curry with rice and there's no other way to finish that than with the sweet treat of chocolate cake.
